<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>One of the most important aspects of the distribution of prime numbers
among the integers is the distribution of the prime numbers within the var &#60;0*02&#62;ious congruence classes modulo some given integer q - in other words, the
distribution of prime numbers in an infinite arithmetic progression. The
most basic question about this distribution is the following: for given num&#60;0*02&#62;bers a and q, what is the number of primes in the congruence class containing
a modulo q? This question was answered by Dirichlet’s theorem, the first
result in analytic number theory, and a discussion by the author regarding
this theorem can be found at [1].</p>
<p>A lot more is known about the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic
progressions in modern times; in fact, these statistics (in the form of strong
results such as the Siegel-Walfisz theorem and the Bombieri-A.I. Vinogradov
theorem) are essential tools in many modern results in analytic (especially
additive) number theory, including the I.M. Vinogradov theorem regarding
the ternary Goldbach conjecture and Yitang Zhang’s recent theorem regard&#60;0*02&#62;ing gaps between primes.
In particular, the classical (relatively) qualitative result in this context is a
generalization of Dirichlet’s theorem and the Prime Number Theorem, into
what is called the Prime Number Theorem for Arithmetic Progressions.
In this project report, we consider a proof the PNT for APs, and discuss
various generalizations and their applications. For most of the proof, we
assume undergraduate proficiency in complex analysis, as well as Chapters
0, 1, 2 and 3 and parts of Chapter 4 from [4]. We will follow Chapters 5, 6
and 7 of [4] for our proof.</p>
<p>Similar project work has been done by the author in past discussion on the
Bombieri-A.I. Vinogradov theorem [2], Dirichlet’s theorem [1], and the I.M.
Vinogradov theorem [3].</p>
<h3>Notation</h3>
<p>We shall describe here the notation that we will need from analytic number
theory.</p>
<p>We shall use the Landau notation</p>
<p><b>f(x) = O(g(x))<b></p>
<p>equivalently with f &#60;0*1c&#62; g and g &#60;0*1d&#62; fto mean that there exists some positive constant C such that |f(x)| ≤ Cg(x) for sufficiently large x. Such an
estimate is called a “big-oh estimate”. We may index our notation with
a variable to denote that the implicit constant depends on the variable in
question, and is only constant when that variable is held constant.
We use
<b>f(x) = o(g(x))</b>
to mean that <b>f(x)/g(x) → 0 as x → ∞.</b> Such an estimate is called a “little&#60;0*02&#62;oh estimate”, and being o(g(x)) is strictly stronger than being <b>O(g(x)).</b>
However, little-oh estimates are qualitative statements, and not very good
for calculation. Hence, in practice, one always use more precise big-oh esti&#60;0*02&#62;mates for calculation (ie, with a smaller g(x)) and only return to the little-oh
estimate in the last step to give a neater but strictly weaker estimate in the
end, if at all. (See for example, the Prime Number Theorem). We may
index here as well, as above.
We will often write
<b>f(x) = g(x) + O(h(x)) or f(x) = g(x) + o(h(x))</b>
1 to mean that there exists a function p(x) which is respectively = <b>O(h(x))</b>
or = <b>o(h(x))</b> such that <b>f(x) = g(x) + p(x).</b>
Finally we use
<b>f(x) ∼ g(x)</b>
interchangeably with
<b>f(x) = g(x) + o(g(x))</b>
to denote the asymptotic equality <b>f(x)/g(x) → 1 as x → ∞.</b>
We use (a, b) to denote the greatest common divisor of a and b and ϕ(n) for
Euler’s totient function,
<b>ϕ(n) = #{x ∈ Z : 1 ≤ x ≤ n,(x, n) = 1}</b>
For any A ⊂ Z, we use 1A(n) for its indicator function,
<b>1A(n) = (
1 if n ∈ A</b>
0 otherwise
We use pn for the nth prime number. Furthermore, for us, n will always
be an integer, p will always be prime, and P shall denote the set of prime
numbers.
For summations and products, we shall use the standard practice of specifying the variable over which the operation is taking place under the P or Q
as well as specifying the other conditions the variable needs to satisfy.
Furthermore, sums over p are over primes and sums over n are over positive
integers. This may lead to sums of the form
<b>X n≤x,X p≤x,X p|m,X n|m,X χ mod q</b>
and so on, which are respectively sums over positive integers up to x, primes
up to x, all prime divisors of m, all divisors of m, and all Dirichlet character
modulo q.
2. Unless otherwise specified, all Dirichlet characters are modulo q.
A ? will be used to denote any theorem which has not been proved in this
report.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4>1.1 The Prime Number Theorem for Arithmetic
Progressions</h4>
<p>One of the, if not the central question in analytic number theory is that
of the distribution of prime numbers among the positive integers. The
“macrostructure” of this distribution is normally studied by examining the
prime-counting function <b>π(x)</b> given by
<b>π(x) = X p≤x</b>
1 where the summation is over primes less than or equal to x, and trying to
determine its asymptotic behaviour as <b>x → ∞.</b> One of the early achievements of analytic methods in number theory was the Prime Number Theorem
(PNT) proved independently by Hadamard and de la Valle-Poussin, which
gives an asymptotic formula for <b>π(x)</b> which says
<b>π(x) ∼ x log x</b>
Another question of much importance in number theory is the distribution
of prime numbers within arithmetic progressions. Information about this
distribution can be used to prove a plethora of interesting facts about the
6. <h3>prime numbers.</h3>
<p>Another early result (perhaps the seminal result in analytic
number theory) proven by Dirichlet states that if
<b>π(x; q, a) = X p≤x p≡a mod q</b>
1 is the number of primes less than x in a given congruence class modulo
q and further suppose that (a, q) = 1 (that is, a is coprime to q), then
<b>π(x; q, a) → ∞ as x → ∞.</b>
If (a, q) 6= 1, there are obviously only finitely many primes in the congruence
class containing a, since p ≡ a (mod q) implies that any prime which divides
both a and q must divide p. Thus, if (a, q) > 1 then the only primes which
can be in the congruence class are the ones divisible by (a, q). If (a, q) is
composite, then there are zero such primes, and if (a, q) is prime there is
one such prime, and hence the number of primes in this congruence class is
finite. Trivially, thus, any arithmetic progression has infinitely many primes
if and only if the first term and common difference are coprime. This is
known as “Dirichlet’s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions”.
Looking at the previous two results, a natural question to ask is a more
precise estimate of exactly how many prime numbers there are in a particular
arithmetic progression; that is, an estimate for π(x; q, a) similar to the PNT’s
estimate for π(x). A priori, there is no reason to assume that the primes
will be more inclined to being concentrated in one co-prime congruence class
modulo q than the others. In fact, there is at least one great conjecture (now
settled, see [5]) which suggests otherwise - the ternary Goldbach conjecture
asserts that any odd prime greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of
three prime numbers. Suppose that the primes are more in the congruence
class congruent to 1 than congruent to 2 modulo 3. This means that the
sum of three primes is more likely to be 0 modulo 3 than it is to be 1 or
2, suggesting that the Goldbach conjecture is false. While this is not a
rigorous argument, it gives an indication as to why the PNT for APs could
potentially be useful in proving the ternary Goldbach conjecture (and in
fact, a partial statement towards the Goldbach conjecture, which is the I.M.
Vinogrdov theorem crucially depends on a strong form of the PNT for APs
- that is, a form with an explicit error term rather than just a qualitative
asymptotic equivalence).
Thus, we would expect that all co-prime congruence classes should roughly
7 have the “same” number of primes. Since there are <b>ϕ(q)</b> many such congruence classes we would expect that for some fixed a and sufficiently large
<b>x, π(x; q, a)</b> should roughly be <b>π(x)/ϕ(q).</b> This turns out to be true, and is
known as the PNT for APs. Precisely, this states that
π(x; q, a) ∼ π(x) ϕ(q) ∼ 1 ϕ(q) x log x
This quantitative version of Dirichlet’s theorem is known as the “Prime
Number Theorem for arithmetic progressions”.
While this is a deep theorem, the asymptotically equality is not sufficient
and we need more information about the error in this theorem. We can
write the above estimate as
π(x; q, a) = 1 ϕ(q) x log x + o
 x log x 
Where o() is the little-oh asymptotic notation. The goal of many results is
to replace the error term with a more precise big-oh estimate. In particular,
the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis provides an improved estimate (this is,
in fact, one of the major reasons why GRH is such an important conjecture).
We shall now elaborate on an alternative way to state these theorems that
is much more natural to use and prove.
1.2 Chebyshev’s ϑ and ψ Functions
It turns out that the prime-counting function π(x; q, a) is very difficult to
use in proofs. Instead, it has been typical since Chebyshev to replace them
by the theta and psi functions, ϑ(x; q, a) and ψ(x; q, a).
An alternative way to write π is the following:
π(x; q; a) = X n≤x n≡a mod q 1P(n)
Where 1A(n) is the indicator function of a set of integers A. Thus, π can be
interpreted as a weighted sum over all elements in a congruence class with
8 the prime elements weighted with 1 and the composite elements weighted
with 0.
However, it turns out that this method of weighting is not ideal for proving
results. Instead, a better weight is the von Mangoldt function, which we
shall define presently. We thus consider instead the sum
X n≤x n≡a mod q Λ(n)
where Λ(n) is the more appropriate weight, the von Mangoldt function.
In this and the subsequent section we will provide a recipe for turning results
about one of the above weighted sums to the other, and try to establish why
the second sum is better suited for manipulation.
One way to motivate this is the following. Clearly, by PNT
π(x) log x
x
= 1 + o(1)
Taking natural logarithms both sides
log π(x) − log x + log log x = log(1 + o(1)) = o(1)
where the last equality is easily established.1 Now, if x = pn, the nth prime
number, then clearly π(x) = n. Thus we have
log n − log pn + log log pn = o(1)
Noting that log log x = o(log x), we thus get
log n = log pn + o(log pn)
Or, in other words,
log n ∼ log pn
1As the logarithm is continuous at 1, if f(x) = o(1), then limx→∞ f(x) = 0. Thus
limx→∞ log(1+f(x)) = log (1 + limx→∞ f(x)) = log(1) = 0. Hence, clearly, log(1+o(1)) =
o(1).
9
This suggests that if instead of giving all primes the same weight 1, we
weight them by their logarithm, the higher primes would contribute more,
multiplying a rough factor of a logarithm. We can formalize this heuristic
by a partial summation2 argument.
Thus, we define a new function, called the Chebyshev ϑ-function in the
literature as follows
ϑ(x) = X
p≤x
log p
which weights each prime by their logarithm instead of 1.
As mentioned above, using partial summation, we can establish the following
two identities
<b>π(x) = ϑ(x) log x + Z x 2 ϑ(t) t(log t) 2 dt ϑ(x) = π(x) log x − Z x 2 π(t) t dt</b>
Using these, we can convert any estimate on the first function into one of
the second, and vice-versa.
In particular, it is easily shown that
limx→∞
<b>1 x Z x 2 π(t) t dt = limx→∞ log x x Z x 2 ϑ(t) t(log t) 2 dt = 0</b>
which shows that PNT is equivalent to ϑ(x) ∼ x. In any case, the first
identity can be used to change any estimate for ϑ to one for π.
Analogous to the prime-counting function for progressions, π(x; q, a), we can
define a ϑ(x; q, a) for progressions as follows
<b>ϑ(x; q, a) = X p≤x p≡a mod q log p</b>
2See Appendix
10 The above identities can then be proved in exactly the same way by replacing
<b>π(x) with π(x; q, a) and ϑ(x) with ϑ(x; q, a).</b>
In some sense, it is natural to work with logarithms of primes when working
with weighted sums. Primes are essentially multiplicative objects, and the
logarithm allows one to pass from the multiplicative to the additive, and
thus form a natural candidate for dealing with sums over primes. However,
it turns out even weighting all primes by their logarithms and all composites
by 0 does not give the most convenient form. The most convenient form is
given instead by Chebyshev’s ψ-function,
ψ(x) = X p k≤x log p
where the sum is over all primes p and all positive integers k such that k ≤ x. In other words, we weight all prime powers by the logarithm of the prime of which they are a power, and all other numbers by 0. The hope then, is that since the prime powers contribute a smaller amount than the primes, the contribution from them can be controlled.
Clearly,
<b>ψ(x) = X∞ k=1 X p k≤x log p = X∞ k=1 X p≤ √k x log p = X∞ k=1 ϑ(x 1/k)</b>
Here note that since for a fixed positive x, limk→∞ x
1/k = 1 thus for sufficiently large k, x
1/k < 2, and thus ϑ(x
1/k) = 0. Thus, all but finitely many
terms vanish, and in particular, the terms are non-vanishing if and only if x 1 k ≥ 2. Taking logarithm to the base 2 on both sides, we see this is the same as requiring k ≤ log2 x.
Thus, <b>ψ(x) = X k≤log2 x ϑ(x 1 k )</b>
Now, trivially, <b>ϑ(x) = P p≤x log p ≤ P p≤x log x ≤ x log x.</b> Also, we know
that ϑ(x) is increasing and thus, ϑ(x 1/2 ) ≥ ϑ(x 1/k) for k ≥ 2. With this we can see that <b>11 ψ(x) − ϑ(x) = X 2≤k≤log2 x ϑ(x 1/k) ≤ X 2≤k≤log2 x ϑ(x 1/2 ) ≤ ϑ(x 1/2 ) log2 x ≤ x 1/2 (log2 x)(log x 1 2 ) = O
 x 1/2 (log x) 2 </b>
Thus, any estimate for ψ can be converted into an estimate for ϑ, provided the estimate has an error larger than O( √ x) by at least two logarithmic factors. In particular, since logarithms always grow slower than powers, for any  > 0, an error of the form O(x 1/2+ ) can be tolerated. This is much tighter than most bounds we have, and thus in any theorem we shall prove here, ψ may be interchanged with ϑ and vice-versa. This also means that the PNT is equivalent to ψ(x) ∼ x. Using the bound ϑ(x) = O(x), which is substantially weaker than PNT and was proven by Chebyshev using elementary methods, we can sharpen the estimate to ψ(x)−ϑ(x) = O( √ x).3
Identically to π and ϑ, we define ψ(x; q, a)
<b>ψ(x; q, a) = X p k≤x p k≡a mod q log p
Furthermore, as above ψ(x; q, a) = X k≤log2 x ϑ(x 1/k; q, a) and thus, 3Clearly ψ(x) − ϑ(x) = ϑ(x 1/2 ) + blog X2 xc k=3 ϑ(x 1/k) ≤ ϑ(x 1/2 ) + ϑ(x 1/3 ) log2 x = O(x 1/2 ) 12 ψ(x; q, a) − ϑ(x; q, a) = X 2≤k≤log2 x ϑ(x 1 k ; q, a) ≤ X 2≤k≤log2 x ϑ(x 1/k) = ψ(x) − ϑ(x)</b>
Hence, all comments as above apply to the Chebyshev functions of a particular progression as well.
1.3 The von Mangoldt Function
We are now in a position to define the von Mangoldt function. This function
is the weight by which the ψ-function had been defined, above. In other
words, Λ(n) = (
log p if n = p k
for some p ∈ P and k ∈ Z + 0 otherwise
Thus we have ψ(x; q, a) = X n≤x n≡a mod q Λ(n)
The reason Λ(n) is used is because it arises naturally in the Dirichlet series
of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann Zeta function. The Riemann
Zeta function is defined as ζ(s) = X∞ n=1 1 ns
which is absolutely convergent for R(s) > 1. In this same region, it can be
shown that 13 − ζ 0 ζ (s) = X∞ n=1 Λ(n) ns
The following identity is equivalent to the above Dirichlet series equality, and
can be interpreted as an analytic statement of the fundamental theorem of
arithmetic.
Theorem 1.1. For any n ∈ N,
log n = X d|n Λ(d)
Proof. By the fundamental theorem, n = Y p a||n p a
Hence, taking logarithms both sides
<b>log n = X p a||n a log p = X p a||n X k≤a
log p = X p k|n
log p = X d|n Λ(d)</b>
where the last equality follows from the definition.
This theorem gives another example of how Λ(n) can arise naturally in
situations involving divisibility.
We will arrange the rest of the report in the following manner. We will first
prove Dirichlet’s theorem and the regular PNT, developing the means to
14
doing so while we do that in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 respectively. Then,
in Chapter 4, we will combine the two proofs to prove the PNT for APs,
and finally in Chapter 5 we will talk about generalizations and applications.

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<h4>Dirichlet’s Theorem</h4>
<p>The discussion in this Chapter has been adapted from [1].
The proof by Dirichlet of the infinitude of primes in arithmetic progressions
is a generalization of a proof by Euler for Euclid’s theorem (that is, that
there are infinitely many primes). Before presenting either of the proofs, we
will develop the mathematical machinery of Dirichlet characters, which will
allow us to perform this generalization.
Virtually any discussion regarding multiplicative structure in arithmetic progressions must depend in some way on the concept of Dirichlet characters.
2.1 Definition of a Dirichlet Character
A Dirichlet character χ is an extension of a character of the multiplicative
group (Z/qZ) × into one on the entirety of Z.
Suppose (G, ·) is a finite abelian group. Then a function e : G → T is called
a character if, for all a, b ∈ G e(a · b) = e(a)e(b) or, in other words, e is a group homomorphism from G to T. The character
given by e(a) = 1 for all a ∈ G is called the “trivial character”. 16
Now, fix an integer q. For any character of (Z/qZ) ×, we can create a corresponding Dirichlet character modulo q, χ : Z → C as follows: χ(n) = ( e(n) if n ∈ (Z/qZ) × 0 otherwise
In other words, χ is supported on the integers coprime to q and is essentially
the same as e at these points. The unique Dirichlet character associated with
the trivial character is called the principal character and is denoted as χ0.
All other characters are known as non-principal characters.
The reader should verify that χ is completely multiplicative (ie, χ(mn) =
χ(m)χ(n) for all integers m and n) and periodic with period q. It can be
shown that, in fact, any completely multiplicative function on N which is
periodic with minimal period q which does not vanish everywhere is actually
a Dirichlet character modulo some q.
We can then show the following orthogonality equation, that we will use
throughout implicitly.
Theorem 2.1 (Orthogonality of Dirichlet Characters, ?). For any fixed
integer q, if χ and χ1 are two Dirichlet characters modulo q, then X a mod q χ(a)χ1(a) = ( ϕ(q) if χ = χ1 0 if χ 6= χ1
where the summation is over any complete residue class of integers modulo q. Furthermore, if χ is some Dirichlet characters modulo q and a and b are integers coprime to q, then X χ mod q χ(a)χ(b) = ( ϕ(q) if a ≡ b (mod q) 0 otherwise We omit the proofs of the above theorem. The interested reader can find a proof in any book on analytic number theory or in the report [1].

2.2 Euler’s Proof for Euclid’s Theorem
We now move to a proof of Euclid’s theorem due to Euler that encapsulate
many ideas that shall be used in our proof of Dirichlet’s theorem. Euclid’s
theorem, which states that there are infinitely many prime numbers has a
elementary proof known since classical times. However, Euler provided an
“analytical” proof of the theorem. He considered the limit lim s→1+ X p 1 p s
where the sum is over all primes p, and showed that this limit is ∞. If
there were only finitely many primes, then this would not be possible, hence
proving the infinitude of primes.
We will now prove that the limit above is actually ∞.
2.2.1 The Riemann Zeta Function
For any real number s > 1, we define the Riemann zeta function, ζ(s) = X∞ n=1 1 ns
We can see this function converges by noting that X∞ n=1 1 ns = 1 +X∞ n=2 Z n n−1 dx ns ≤ 1 +X ∞ n=2 Z n n−1 dx x s = 1 + Z ∞ 1 dx x s
Thus, ζ(s) ≤ 1 + 1 s − 1
is convergent for all s > 1.
The zeta function encodes in it a lot of information about the distribution
of primes among the integers. In particular, it can be extended to a holomorphic function on the entire complex plane except for s = 1, where it
18
has a simple pole. The distribution of zeroes of this extensison is intimately
connected to the distribution of primes and the Riemann Hypothesis, one
of the biggest unsolved problems in mathematics is a statement about these
zeroes.
2.2.2 Euler Product
Notwithstanding the holomorphic extension, the zeta function we have defined itself encodes a lot about the primes. In particular, the zeta function
admits a product formula which is essentially an analytic statement of the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This product formula, known as the
Euler product of ζ(s) is given in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.2. For every s > 1, ζ(s) = X∞ n=1 1 ns = Y p 1 1 − 1/ps
where the product is over all primes p.
Proof. Suppose M and N are positive integers such that M > N. Every
n ≤ N can be uniquely written as a product of primes. These primes shall
obviously be ≤ N, and cannot occur more than M times in the product.
Hence, it follows that every term in the left of the following inequality shall
also be in the right of the inequality. That is, X N n=1 1 ns ≤ Y p≤N &#60;0*02&#62; 1 + 1 p s + 1 p 2s + · · · + 1 pMs &#60;0*13&#62;
Taking first M → ∞ and then N → ∞ in the left, we get X N n=1 1 ns ≤ Y p &#60;0*12&#62; 1 1 − p−s &#60;0*13&#62;
Finally, taking N → ∞, 19 X∞ n=1 1 ns ≤ Y p &#60;0*12&#62; 1 1 − p−s &#60;0*13&#62;
For the reverse inequality, note that if we consider all products of primes
such that each prime is ≤ N and does not occur more than M times, we
shall get finitely many distinct integers. Thus, Y p≤N &#60;0*12&#62; 1 + 1 p s + 1 p 2s + · · · +1
pMs &#60;0*13&#62; ≤ X∞ n=1 1 ns
Again, taking M → ∞ and then N → ∞, we obtain Y p &#60;0*12&#62; 1 1 − p−s &#60;0*13&#62; ≤ X∞ n=1 1 ns
The equality follows from these two inequalites.
2.2.3 Proof of Euclid’s Theorem
We are now in a position to prove Euclid’s theorem.
Theorem 2.3. We have, lim s→1+ X p 1 p s = ∞
where the sum is taken over all primes p.
Proof. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the Euler product, and
using the continuity of logarithms, − X p log &#60;0*12&#62; 1 − 1 p s&#60;0*13&#62; = log ζ(s)
Since log(1 + x) = x + O(x 2), we get, 20 − X p &#60;0*14&#62; − 1 p s + O &#60;0*12&#62; 1 p 2s &#60;0*13&#62;&#60;0*11&#62; = log ζ(s)
Thus, since P p 1/p2s ≤ P n 1/n2s , which is convergent, and hence bounded, X p 1 p s + O(1) = log ζ(s) Now, ζ(s) ≥ PM n=1 1/ns for every M. Hence, lim inf s→1+ ζ(s) ≥ X M n=1 1 n
for every M. Clearly, since the harmonic series diverges, the right side is unbounded. Thus, lims→1+ ζ(s) = ∞. Combining this with the earlier estimate on P p 1/ps , we get that lim s→1+ X p 1 p s = ∞
2.3 Proof Sketch
In this section, we will connect the previous two sections to give a sketch of
our proof of Dirichlet’s theorem. Please refer to [1] for information about
characters of finite abelian groups.
Now, we shall adapt our theorems for groups characters to Dirichlet char &#60;0*02&#62;acters.
Theorem 2.4. For any non-trivial Dirichlet character modulo q, we have X q n=1 χ(n) = 0 21
Proof. Since χ(n) = 0 if (n, q) > 1, we have X q n=1 χ(n) = X 1≤n≤q (a,q)=1 χ(n) = X 1≤n≤q (a,q)=1 e([n]) = X a∈(Z/qZ)× e(a)
Where the last equality follows from the fact that n varies over the given domain, [n] goes traverses all the elements of (Z/qZ) ×. Thus invoking the fact about group characters that P a∈G e(a) = 0, we get X q n=1 χ(n) = 0 We now state and prove the final property of Dirichlet characters that we shall need.
Theorem 2.5. For any non-principal Dirichlet character χ, and any integer k, we have
 &#60;0*0c&#62;
 &#60;0*0c&#62;
 &#60;0*0c&#62;
 &#60;0*0c&#62;
 &#60;0*0c&#62;

&#60;0*0c&#62; 
&#60;0*0c&#62;
 &#60;0*0c&#62;
&#60;0*0c&#62;
&#60;0*0c&#62; ≤ q
Proof. Clearly, by previous theorems and the periodicity of χ, if we write k = aq + b, with b < q X n≤k χ(n) = X n≤aq χ(n) + X aq&#60;n&le;aq+b χ(n) = X n≤b χ(n)
Thus, by the triangle inequality,
&#60;0*0c&#62;
&#60;0*0c&#62;X n&le;k χ(n)
&#60;0*0c&#62;&le; X n&le;b |χ(n)| ≤ b ≤ q
22
2.3.1 Adapting Euler’s Proof of Euclid’s Theorem
We can now see how Euler’s proof for Eulcid’s theorem may be adapted
here. Fix integers q and a such that (a, q) = 1. We consider the following
limit
lim s→1+ X p≡a (mod q) 1 p s
where the sum is now only over all primes in the same congruence class as a
modulo q. Our attempt shall be to show that this limit is ∞, which would,
analogous to Euclid’s theorem, show that there are infinitely many primes
in that congruence class.
As stated before, sums over elements in a particular congruence class are
normally intractable. However, using a trick, we can reduce these sums to
over all prime p.
Now, since (a, q) = 1, we have that 1 φ(q) X χ χ(p)χ(a) = ( 1 if p ≡ a (mod q) 0 otherwise
Hence, we can rewrite the sum as X p≡a (mod q) 1 p s = X p 1 φ(q) X χ χ(p)χ(a) p s
Since everything converges uniformly and absolutely for s > s0 > 1, we can rewrite this as X p≡a (mod q) 1 p s = 1 φ(q) X χ χ(a) X p χ(p) p s
Hence, it suffices to study the behaviour of P p χ(p)/ps as s → 1 +.
Now, the sum can be rewritten as 23 X p≡a (mod q) 1 p s = 1 φ(q) X p χ0(p) p s + 1 φ(q) X χ6=χ0 χ(a) X p χ(p) p s
where the second sum is over non-prinicipal characters.
Clearly, X p χ0(p) p s = X p-q 1 p
p4w8 s
Since there are only finitely many primes dividing q, this last sum goes to
infinity as s → 1
+, as in the proof of Euclid’s theorem. Thus, if we show
that as s → 1
+, the non-principal part is bounded (that is, P
p χ(p)/ps =
Oq(1)),the theorem is proved.
Hence, we see that by careful use of Dirichlet characters, we have reduced
our problem to a sum over all primes p.
2.3.2 Sketch of the Proof
We shall now sketch a proof of the fact that for non-principal characters, P
p χ(p)/ps = O(1) as s → 1
+. This shall be similar to the proof of Euclid’s
theorem, using the zeta function.
In place of ζ(s), we will consider a generalization associated with each character χ called the Dirichlet L-function, L(s, χ), given by L(s, χ) = X∞ n=1 χ(n) ns
wherever the series converges.
Similar to ζ(s), there exists an Euler product formula for L(s, χ) viz. L(s, χ) = X∞ n=1 χ(n) ns = Y p 1 1 − χ(p)/ps
Taking logarithms on both sides, we get 24 log L(s, χ) = − X p
log &#60;0*12&#62; 1 − χ(p) p s
 &#60;0*13&#62;
Using log(1 + x) = x + O(x2 ), log L(s, χ) = − X p
&#60;0*14&#62; − χ(p) p s + O &#60;0*12&#62; 1 p 2s &#60;0*13&#62;&#60;0*15&#62;
Thus, we get log L(s, χ) = X p χ(p) p s + O(1)
Hence, if L(1, χ) is finite and non-zero, and L(s, χ) is continuous, then the
left of this equation will be bounded as s → 1 +, and hence P p χ(p)/ps is bounded.
In the above argument, there are several holes we need to fill to make the argument rigorous. Firstly, we need to prove the product formula for L(s, χ); secondly, since the numbers involved may, in general, be complex numbers, we need to clearly define the branch of the logarithm we are using and its properties; thirdly, we need to show that L(s, χ) is continuous at s = 1; and finally, we need to show that L(1, χ) 6= 0.
2.4 Filling the Holes: Reducing to L(1, χ) 6= 0
2.4.1 The First Logarithm
We define our first logarithm, log1 as log1 &#60;0*12&#62; 1 1 − z &#60;0*13&#62; = X∞ k=1 z k k
for |z| < 1. Clearly in the chosen domain, this function converges absolutely.
25
Theorem 2.6. If |z| < 1, then e log1( 1 1−z ) = 1 1 − z
Proof. Let z = reiθ. Note that it is sufficient to show that (1−reiθ)e P∞ k=1 (reiθ) k)/k is constant (since putting r = 0 gives 1, as it should).
Thus, differentiating this we get " −e iθ + (1 − reiθ)e iθ X∞ k=1 (reiθ) k−1 !# e P∞ k=1 (reiθ) k)/k
A quick calculation using the sum of an infinite geometric series shows that
the term in the square brackets is zero, hence we are done.
2.4.2 Euler Product
We now prove the Euler product for L(s, χ).
Theorem 2.7. For any character χ and s > 1, L(s, χ) = X n χ(n) ns = Y p 1 1 − χ(p)/ps
Proof. Clearly, the product converges since P p χ(p)/ps converges. Let us represent the sum over positive integeres by Σ and the product as Π. Further, define ΣN = X n≤N χ(n) ns ΠN = Y p≤N

Now, fix  > 0. Clearly, since the product is finite, limM→∞ ΠN,M = ΠN .
Furthermore, since the sum and product converge, limN→∞ ΠN = Π and
limN→∞ ΣN = Σ. Hence, we can choose N and M large enough that
|ΠN,M − ΠN | < 
|ΠN − Π| < 
|ΣN − Σ| < 
Furthermore, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and the multiplicativity of the Dirichlet characters, for large enough M, ΠM,N −ΣN is the tail
end of a convergent series, and can thus be made < .
Hence,
|Σ − Π| ≤ |ΣN − Σ| + |ΠM,N − ΣN | + |ΠN,M − ΠN | + |ΠN − Π| < 4
for any  > 0. Thus, clearly Σ = Π.
2.4.3 Behaviour of L(s, χ)
In this section, we examine the behaviour of L(s, χ).
Theorem 2.8. If χ0 is the principal character modulo q, then
L(s, χ0) = ζ(s) Y p|q &#60;0*12&#62; 1 − 1 p s &#60;0*13&#62;
where the product is over all primes p dividing q.
Proof. This trivially follows from the Euler products of the two sides.
27
Thus, in some sense, the behaviour of the L-function associated with the
principal Dirichlet character is the same as the zeta function. For nonprincipal characters, the situation is very different.
Theorem 2.9. If χ is a non-principal character, then L(s, χ) exists for
s > 0. Moreover, it is continuously differentiable for 0 < s < ∞, and there
exists constants c, c0 > 0 such that as s → ∞ L(s, χ) = 1 + O(e −cs) L 0 (s, χ) = O(e −c 0s )
Proof. Suppose s > 0. Using summation by parts1 X n≤N χ(n) ns = 1 Ns X n≤N χ(n) + Z N 0   X n≤x χ(n)  &#60;0*12&#62; −s x

dx
Note that since



P
n≤N χ(n)


 ≤ q, the first term goes to zero as N → ∞.
Furthermore, the integral is bounded above by the integral R qs
xs+1 dx, which
clearly converges for s + 1 > 1 (that is s > 0) when N → ∞. Hence, the
partial sums of the series converges, and hence L(s, χ) exists for s > 0.
Furthermore, the series converges uniformly for s > σ > 0. We can apply
a similar argument to show that the term-wise derivative also converges
uniformly for s > σ > 0, proving that L(s, χ) is continuously differentiable.
With this, we can now define our second logarithm.
2.4.4 The Second Logarithm
We define our second logarithm, log2 as
log2 L(s, χ) = − Z ∞ s L 0 (t, χ) L(t, χ) dt
1See appendices
28
Theorem 2.10. If s > 1, e log2 L(s,χ) = L(s, χ) Proof. Differentiating e − log2 L(s,χ)L(s, χ) with respect to s, we get − L 0 (s, χ) L(s, χ) e − log2 L(s,χ)L(s, χ) + e − log2 L(s,χ)L 0 (s, χ) = 0
Hence e − log2 L(s,χ)L(s, χ) is constant. Taking s → ∞, this is easily seen to be 1.
We can now connect our two logarithms to show that we can meaningfully “take logarithms on both sides” of the Euler product for L(s, χ). Theorem 2.11. If s > 1, log2 L(s, χ) = X p log1 &#60;0*12&#62; 1 1 − χ(p)/ps &#60;0*13&#62;
Proof. We see that e P p log1 &#60;0*10&#62; 1 1−χ(p)/ps &#60;0*11&#62; = Y p e log1 &#60;0*10&#62; 1 1−χ(p)/ps&#60;0*11&#62; = Y p&#60;0*12&#62; 1
1 − χ(p)/ps &#60;0*13&#62;
The right most quantity is, by the Euler product, L(s, χ).
Also, e
log2 L(s,χ) = L(s, χ)
Hence, since their exponential is the same, they must differ by some integer
multiple of 2π. That is,
log2 L(s, χ) − X p log1


1 − χ(p)/ps

= 2πM(s)
29
Now, clearly, the left side of the equality is a continuous function of s. Hence,
M(s) is an integer valued continuous function, and thus constant. Taking
s → ∞, this is clearly 0.
Putting all of this together, the proof sketch given earlier can be formalized
by filling the holes in the argument with these patches.
Therefore, to prove this theorem, we need to establish that L(1, χ) 6= 0.
2.5 The Non-vanishing of the L-function
We shall now prove that L(1, χ) 6= 0 for all non-principal Dirichlet characters. We shall distinguish between two types of characters. If a character χ is
always real, (that is χ(n) = 0, +1, −1 or, to put it another way χ(n) = χ(n)),
we call it a real character. An equivalent characterization of a real character
is that it is a character χ such that χ
2 = χ0. A character which is not a real
character is called a complex character. We shall treat these two separately.
2.5.1 Complex Characters
Suppose χ1 is a complex Dirichlet character such that L(1, χ1) = 0. We will
now derive a contradiction.
For s > 1, define f as follows
f(s) = Y
χ
L(s, χ)
where the product is taken over all Dirichlet characters modulo q.
Theorem 2.12. If s > 1, f(s) is real-valued, and furthermore
f(s) ≥ 1
Proof. We know that
30
L(s, χ) = exp X
p
log1

Hence,

L(s, χ) = exp X



L(s, χ) = exp X

L(s, χ) = exp X

k=1

kpks X

χ(p

However, from a previous theorem we know that P
χ χ(n) is either 0 or φ(q),
and thus is a real non-negative quantity. Hence, the term in the exponential
shall be a sum over non-negative quantities and, thus non-negative. This
implies that its exponential shall be real and greater than 1.
Now we know that L(1, χ1) = 0, that is L(s, χ1) has a zero of order at least
1. Hence, to compensate for that, some other L-function in the product
must be diverging to infinity. We know that L(s, χ0) has a pole of order 1
at s = 1, since ζ(s) has a pole of order 1. However, if L(1, χ1) = 0, then
L(1, χ1) = L(1, χ1) = 0, and hence, L(1, χ1) also has a zero of order at least
1 at s = 1. However, these are all distinct terms in the product, and no
other term in the product can diverge to infinity (since we have show that
for non-principal characters, their L-functions are well-defined and bounded
at s = 1). Hence, the product f(s) has a zero of at least order 1 at s = 1,
contradicting the above theorem.
The above contradiction shall yield that no complex character can satisfy
L(1, χ1) = 0. Note that the above proof does not work for real characters
31
as for them χ = χ, and thus we can only show that one L-function in the
product vanishes, which is not sufficient to make the entire product vanish.
We formalize the above argument in the following theorems.
Theorem 2.13. If L(1, χ1) = 0 then L(1, χ1) = 0.
Proof. It is easy to see from their definitions that L(1, χ1) = L(1, χ1), from
which the claim follows.
Theorem 2.14. If χ is a non-principal character, such that L(1, χ) = 0,
then
L(s, χ) = O(s − 1)
as s → 1.
Proof. Applying the mean-value theorem on L(s, χ) in 1 ≤ s ≤ 2, we get
that for some t ∈ (1, s)
L(s, χ) − L(1, χ) = L
0
(t, χ) (s − 1)
Now note that |L
0
(s, χ)| is continuous and thus has a maximum (say C) on
[1, 2]. Furthermore, L(1, χ) = 0.
Hence for 1 ≤ s ≤ 2,
|L(s, χ)| ≤ C|s − 1|
proving the claim.
Theorem 2.15. For the principal Dirichlet character χ0, we have
L(s, χ0) = O

1
s − 1

as s → 1.
32
Proof. We know that
L(s, χ0) = ζ(s)
Y

Also, clearly as s → 1, the terms in the product are O(1).
However, we have shown earlier that for s > 1
ζ(s) < 1 +
1
s − 1
Putting this together, clearly L(s, χ0) = O(1/(s − 1)).
Theorem 2.16. For any complex character χ1, L(1, χ1) 6= 0.
Proof. We know that for χ (6= χ0, χ1, χ1), L(s, χ) exists and is bounded.
That is L(s, χ) = O(1) as s → 1. Now,
f(s) = Y
χ
L(s, χ) = L(s, χ0)L(s, χ1)L(s, χ1)
Y
χ6=χ0,χ1,χ1

Therefore, by our theorems
f(s) = O



× O(s − 1) × O(s − 1) × O(1) = O(s − 1)
Therefore, at s = 1, f(s) = 0 < 1, contradicting our previous theorem.
2.5.2 Real Characters
We now move on to the final, and the deepest part of this theorem, the proof
that for real characters χ, L(1, χ) 6= 0.
Define S(x) as follows
33
S(x) = X
mn≤x
χ(n)
(mn)
1/2
We will obtain two different asymptotic formulae for S(x) which shall establish our theorem.
Before that, we shall prove the facts we need to establish the formulae.
Theorem 2.17. Suppose that χ is a real Dirichlet character and n is any
positive integer. Then,
X
d|n
χ(d) ≥
(
0 for all n

Proof. Note that since χ is multiplicative absolutely,
X
d|n
χ(d) = Y

k=0
χ(p
a
)
!
Where p
a
||n denotes that p is a prime dividing n such that a is the largest
exponent for which p
a divides n.
Hence, clearly, it is sufficient to establish this fact for prime powers, to
establish it in general.
Now for n = p
a
, clearly,
X
d|n
χ(d) = χ(1)+χ(p)+χ(p
2
)+· · ·+χ(p
a
) = χ(1)+χ(p)+χ(p)
2+· · ·+χ(p)
a
Clearly, since χ(p) is 0, 1, −1,
X
d|n
χ(d) =



a + 1 if χ(p) = 1
0 if χ(p) = −1 and a is odd
1 if χ(p) = −1 and a is even
1 if χ(p) = 0
34
Thus, we see that this sum satisfies the inequality for prime powers, and
thus for all positive integers.
With this, we can establish a lower bound on the growth rate of S(x).
Theorem 2.18. We have,
S(x)  log x
In particular S(x) → ∞ as x → ∞.
Proof. The defining formula of S(x) can clearly be rewritten the following
way,
S(x) = X
n≤x
X
d|n
χ(d)
n1/2
where we have replaced mn by n and n by d.
Hence, clearly
S(x) = X
n≤x
1
n1/2
X
d|n
χ(d)
Now, using the bound earlier established, we know the inner sum is greater
than 0 always, and greater than 1 for square n. Hence,
S(x) ≥
X
n≤x
n=t2,t∈Z
1
n1/2
Or, in other words,
S(x) ≥
X

2≤x

X
t≤x1/2

35
We shall now use Dirichlet’s hyperbola method2
to prove an asymptotic
formula for S(x).
Theorem 2.19.
S(x) = 2x
1/2L(1, χ) + O(1)
Proof. Note that the defining formula for S(x) can be written as follows
S(x) = X
